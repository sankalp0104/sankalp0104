### Hi there. I am Sankalp Srivastava.  ðŸ‘‹

### I am a competitve programming enthusiast. I love it but not yet good at it. 
Here are some ideas to get you started:

Iâ€™m currently working on improving on my competitve programming skills.   
I am thrilled to learn new methods rather quicker methods of solving a problem.   
Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik's cude (nowadays very commmon).   
I am very much interested in knowing different people and their accents.   
Big Fan of Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter.   
Love watching movies.   
I'll keep adding more stuff if remember.ðŸ˜…
